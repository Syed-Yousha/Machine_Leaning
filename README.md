# Machine_Leaning
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and examples that cover a wide range of topics. It includes step-by-step implementations of important algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. Each folder focuses on a different concept to help build a clear understanding of how machine learning models work in practice. The goal of this repository is to make learning machine learning easier through simple explanations and practical code examples that can be applied to real-world problems.
